## Program Overview

This program is designed to transcribe audio files into text using OpenAI's **Whisper** model from the `transformers` library. It processes `.wav` audio files by iterating through directories, applying an automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline to each file, and outputting the transcribed text.
